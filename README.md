# The Impact of Covid on the US Economy and Food Insecurity
The objective of this project is to analyze and demonstrate the impact of COVID on the economy and food insecurity issue in the US.

# Project Background
COVID took us by surprise in 2020. While people were still trying to figure out what it was and how it was going to impact our life, it quickly turned into a global pandemic. On March 13, President Donald Trump declared the novel coronavirus a national emergency. On the same day, schools in Illinois were closed to in-person instruction. On March 20, JB Pritzker, Governor of the State of Illinois issued the ‘stay at home’ order for Illinois residents. It felt like the whole world was put on pause. It was not until December of 2020 when Pfizer and Moderna vaccines received the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that people started to see some light at the end of the tunnel. Before COVID, there were already many people in the U.S. who lived in food-insecure households. After COVID hit the US like a cyclone, there were even more people who lost their jobs overnight, putting more families at risk for affording enough food. Long lines at food banks across the US were seen in the news everyday. The actual impact to the US economy and poor families at the macro level can be revealed from analyzing The US GDP data and snap program data.
